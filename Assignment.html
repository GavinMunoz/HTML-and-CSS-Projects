			Broly (ブロリー Burorī) is a fictional character in the Dragon Ball series. 
			Two versions of the character exist: the original Broly, 
			a major villain who appeared in a trilogy of 90's Dragon Ball Z anime films, 
			Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan (1993), Broly – Second Coming (1994), and Bio-Broly (1994); 
			and a reworked canonical iteration of the character that debuted in the film Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018), 
			and once again served as the primary antagonist and major anti-hero in the Dragon Ball series.
